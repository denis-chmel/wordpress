</header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>Welcome to gobask.com (the “Site”), a website operated by Bask Labs, Inc. (“Bask, “we”, “us”, or “our”).  We provide our users (“you”) a new meal recommendation engine through the Site, our mobile applications (the “Apps”) and services offered through the Site and Apps (collectively, the Site, Apps and such services, the “Services”).  We know you are concerned about your privacy, so we developed this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain how we collect, use, and disclose information from and/or about you, whether you are simply visiting our Site, browsing our menus or ordering a delicious meal that will be delivered to your door.</p>
<p>(1)	How We Collect Information.<br />
(a)	So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we mean contact information (e.g., name, address, email address, or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual. When we use the phrase “Anonymous Information” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is neither used nor intended to be used to personally identify an individual.</p>
<p>(b)	Personal Information.  We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily when you register, order a meal or otherwise use the Services.</p>
<p>(I)	Accounts. When you create an “Account”, we collect your name, email address and a password.  In order for the Services to work as designed, we will also ask you to provide information about your health goals (e.g., lose weight, reduce blood pressure, or improve energy levels); what diet you follow (e.g., vegan, pescetarian, paleo) what your tastes are (e.g., rating certain menu items with a thumbs up or thumbs down so that we learn what you like) and where you are (e.g., your home or office location so we know where to deliver your order). We may also ask you to provide certain optional Personal Information, such as age and gender.  If you elect to login into your Account by using a social networking site (e.g., Facebook) (an “SNS”), we will receive all of the information from the SNS that you authorize us to receive from the SNS.</p>
<p>(II)	Purchase Information. One type of Personal Information collected through the Services when you purchase products is “Purchase Information”, which means information about your purchase (including the menu item, price of each item and the restaurant from which you purchased) and all information necessary to process your order. Purchase Information may include the following: (i) your name as it appears on the credit card, (ii) the credit card type (VISA, MasterCard, American Express or any other issuer then accepted by one of ur Delivery Partners), (iii) a valid credit card number; (iv) the date of expiration of your credit card, (v) your billing address, and (vi) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card.  To be clear, we do not deliver any menu items to you.  We work with delivery services (each a “Delivery Partner”) and they are the ones who process your payment information.  </p>
<p>(III)	Communications. When you communicate with us through the Services, for example, by sending us an email, we may collect and store any information that is contained in your communications with us. To receive our newsletter, you must provide your email address.  You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the quality of your experience.  </p>
<p>(c)	Anonymous Information.  As you use the Services, certain Anonymous Information may be passively collected and stored, such as your Internet protocol address, browser type, domain names and access times.  We may also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the products and information for which you searched, viewed and/or added to your cart. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser while you are viewing a website.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies.  You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting a Cookie from the websites you visit.  If you do not accept Cookies, however, you will not be able to purchase any products through the Site. </p>
<p>(2)	How We Use Information.<br />
(a)	Personal Information.  We will use your Personal Information to:<br />
•	Make meal recommendations and otherwise provide you with the Services and customer support<br />
•	Administer your Account;<br />
•	Process your payments and fulfill your orders;<br />
•	Improve the quality of the Site and the Services;<br />
•	Tailor the features, performance and support of the Services to you;<br />
•	Market our products and services to you and those of third parties we believe may be of interest to you;<br />
•	Respond to your requests, resolve disputes and/or troubleshoot problems, and<br />
•	Communicate with you about the Services.<br />
We may also use your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information records by excluding information that makes the information personally identifiable to you. We may use this Anonymous in the same way and to the same extent that we can use any other Anonymous Information under this Agreement. </p>
<p>You can opt out of receiving certain communications from the Site such as our newsletter by (i) clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email, (ii) clicking the opt-out on your Account page, (iii) emailing us at info@gobask.com, (iv) sending us a request by postal mail, or (v) clicking this link. Please note that even if you unsubscribe or opt-out, we may still send you Service related communications (e.g., emails related to your orders or comments).</p>
<p>(b)	 Anonymous Information.  We may, through our use of Cookies, keep you logged into our Site, track your session history, and tailor content and advertisements to you.  We may use your Anonymous Information to analyze usage patterns so that we may enhance the Site or Services, improve our internal operations and the content of our software, notify visitors about updates to our Site or Services, and improve the efficacy of our content and advertisements that appear on the Site. We may also use your Anonymous Information (including Cookies) to market our products and services to you, whether on our Site or on third party websites.  We may combine such data with certain of your Personal Information.</p>
<p>(3)	How We Disclose Information.<br />
(a)	   Personal Information,  We may disclose certain Personal Information:</p>
<p>•	To third party vendors who help us provide the Services, including our Delivery Partners<br />
•	To third parties to whom you ask us to send Personal Information;<br />
•	To a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “Affiliates”), in the event we have such Affiliates in the future, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy;<br />
•	To a company that merges with us, acquires us, or purchases our assets, in which case such company may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy; or<br />
•	If we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (i) resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Terms of Use; (ii) comply with relevant laws or to respond to requests from law enforcement or other government officials relating to investigations or alleged illegal activity, in which case we can (and you authorize us to) disclose Personal Information without subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (iii) protect and defend our rights or property or the rights and property of you or third parties.</p>
<p>(b)	  Anonymous Information.  We reserve the right to disclose Anonymous Information publicly without restriction, including to third party vendors who may help us enhance or provide the Services or to third parties.</p>
<p>(4)	Third Party Websites.  The Services may contain links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us, including our Delivery Partners or the restaurants featured by our analytics engine. We have no control over, do not review and are not responsible for the privacy policies of or content displayed on such other websites. When you click on a link to any other website or location, you will leave our Services and go to another site and another entity may collect Personal Information or Anonymous Information from you.  We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content.  Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content or to any collection of Information after you click on links to connect to such outside websites.<br />
(5)	Information Collected by Third Parties.<br />
(a)	Analytic Services. We may use third party analytics services such as Google Analytics to collect information about how you use and interact with our Services.  Such third party analytics services may use cookies to gather information such as the pages you visited, your IP address, a date/time stamp for your visit and which site referred you to the Services.  We use these analytics services to help us analyze how people use the Services, to improve the Services, to customize the content users see based upon their interests and to send email to users who are not actively using the Services. For more information about how these entities use this information, and how you can opt-out of their use of such information, please refer to their privacy policies made available on their websites.  The list above may not be a comprehensive list of such third parties and we reserve the right to change our vendors at any time without notice.</p>
<p>(b)	  Collection of Information by Advertisers.  We may also use third parties to serve ads through the Services.  Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Services.  They do this by using Cookies, pixel tags or other technologies.  Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site and the other sites tracked by these third parties.  This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Cookies, pixel tags and other technologies in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies and other technologies.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: http://www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>
<p>(6)	Our Relationship with Social Networking Sites.<br />
As noted above, we offer you interfaces that allow you to connect to your Account through an SNS (e.g., Facebook).  We will work with the SNS’s application protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows you to authorize us to access your account on that SNS on your behalf.  In order to provide this authorization, you will not provide us with your user name or password to the SNS, but you will need to log-in to that SNS directly through our Site. Once authorized by you, the SNS will provide us a token that allows the SNS to recognize us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account. You will be able to revoke our access to any SNS at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SNS, though such revocation may limit the Services we are able to provide you.  In connection with the Services, you may be able to post content to the SNS using your SNS account accessed through the Site. </p>
<p>(7)	Updating and Controlling Your Information.   If you have an Account with us, you may update certain of your Personal Information by emailing us at info@gobask.com. You may request deletion of your Personal Information by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete Personal Information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives and we may also retain Anonymous Information about your use of our Services.  Once we disclose some of your Personal Information to third parties, we cannot access that Personal Information any longer and cannot force the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures.</p>
<p>(8)	Security.<br />
Bask has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure your Personal Information.  Among the security measures taken are SSL Technology and, if you have an Account, a login process requiring a password and username. If you become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of your password, please contact Bask’ Customer Service Department by email at info@gobask.com.</p>
<p>(9)	Changes to this Privacy Policy.<br />
This Privacy Policy is subject to revision from time to time on a going-forward basis.  We will post any revised version of the Privacy Policy on this page.  If we make any material changes to it, we will also send you notice to the last email address you have provided to us.  Continued use of our Services following notice of such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.</p>
<p>(10)	Contact Us.<br />
If you have questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us by sending an email to info@gobask.com.</p>
