</header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>Welcome to gobask.com (the “Site”), a website operated by Bask Labs, Inc. (“Bask, “we”, “us”, or “our”).  We provide a new meal recommendation engine through the Site, our mobile applications (the “Apps”) and services offered through the Site and Apps (collectively, the Site, Apps and such services, the “Services”).  Here’s how it works:  we ask you a little about yourself – including where you live and your taste preferences.  We then search the menus of restaurants across your city and provide you personalized meal recommendations that are tailored to your specific health goals, taste preferences, and location.  With Bask, you’ll order the perfect meal every time. Once you decide upon a recommendation, you can order your meal through one of our affiliated delivery services.</p>
<p>The following terms and conditions (the “Terms of Use”) form a binding agreement between you and us, and govern your use of the Site, the Services and any Orders (defined below) that you place. </p>
<p>Please read these terms of use carefully.  By accessing and using the Services, you agree to be bound by these terms of use.  If you do not wish to be bound by these terms, you may not access or use the Services.  </p>
<p>TO BE CLEAR, WE PROVIDE THE MEAL RECOMMENDATION ENGINE AND THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO ORDER A MEAL THROUGH ONE OF OUR FOOD DELIVERY PARTNERS, FOR EXAMPLE GRUBHUB (EACH, A “DELIVERY PARTNER”).  WHEN YOU PURCHASE A MEAL YOU DO SO THROUGH THE APPLICABLE DELIVERY PARTNER, NOT US.  THE DELIVERY PARTNER’S TERMS OF SERVICE AND PRIVACY POLICY, AND NOT OUR TERMS AND PRIVACY POLICY, GOVERN YOUR RELATIONSHIP ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND THE DELIVERY OF THE MEAL.  WE ASSUME NO LIABILTY FOR THE ACTS AND OMISSIONS OF THE DELIVERY PARTNER. PLEASE REVIEW THEIR TERMS AND POLICIES BEFORE MAKING A PURCHASE TO ENSURE YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THEIR WAY OF DOING BUSINESS.</p>
<p>1.	ACCOUNTS.   In order to use certain features of the Site, including the ability to purchase any meals, you must register for an account (your “Account”) and provide us your email address and password (“Credentials”) or connect to the Services through a social networking site (an “SNS”) in which case we will access registration information that you authorize from the SNS.  You may not transfer or share your Credentials with any third parties. If someone accesses our Services using your Account Information, we will rely on the Credentials presented and will assume that it is really you or your representative who is accessing the Services. You are solely responsible for any and all use of your Credentials and all Orders and activities that occur in connection with the Account. If you access the Services through an SNS, you may link your Account with your account on the SNS.  We reserve the right to take any action to ensure the security of the Site and your Account, including terminating your Account, changing your password, or requesting additional information to authorize transactions on your Account. In no event and under no circumstances will Bask be held liable to you for any liabilities or damages resulting from or arising out of (i) any action or inaction of Bask under this provision, (ii) any compromise of the confidentiality of your Account or password and (iii) any unauthorized access to your Account or use of your password. You agree to notify us immediately if you become aware that your Account Information is being used without authorization. We may suspend or terminate your Account in accordance with these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>2.	OWNERSHIP AND APPLICATION LICENSE. You understand and acknowledge that the software, code, proprietary methods and systems used to provide the Services (“Our Technology”) are: (i) copyrighted by us and/or our licensors under United States and international copyright laws; (ii) subject to other intellectual property and proprietary rights and laws; and (iii) owned by us or our licensors. Our Technology may not be copied, modified, reproduced, republished, posted, transmitted, sold, offered for sale, or redistributed in any way without our prior written permission and the prior written permission of our applicable licensors. You must abide by all copyright notices, information, or restrictions contained in or attached to any of Our Technology. Nothing in these Terms of Use grants you any right to receive delivery of a copy of Our Technology or to obtain access to Our Technology except as generally and ordinarily permitted through the Site according to these Terms of Use. Furthermore, nothing in these Terms of Use will be deemed to grant a license to Our Technology. Certain of the names, logos, and other materials displayed on Products, the Site or in the Services constitute trademarks, tradenames, service marks or logos (“Marks”) of Bask or other entities. You are not authorized to use any such Marks. Ownership of all such Marks and the goodwill associated therewith remains with us or those other entities.</p>
<p>If you elect to download one of our Apps, the following also applies: we grant you a personal, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license (without a right to sublicense) to download, install and use a copy of the App on a mobile device or computer that you own or control solely for your personal and professional use, subject at all times to the Terms including the restrictions on use, the acceptable use provisions and the right to remove your Content (as defined below) at our discretion at any time.  Furthermore, with respect to any App accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (an “App Store Sourced Application”), you will only use the App Store Sourced Application: (i) on an Apple-branded product that runs iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system) and (ii) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.  Use of the Application is also subject to the provisions of Section 10(d) below.</p>
<p>3.	RULES REGARDING INFORMATION AND OTHER CONTENT. When you access the Services, you obtain access to various kinds of information and materials, all of which we call “Content.” As part of the Services, you may be able to upload onto the Site certain Content, for example reviews.  You are entirely responsible for each individual item of Content that you post on the Site and, as between you and us, you retain ownership and any intellectual property rights in the Content you post. You grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, fully sublicenseable, worldwide license, under any and all of your copyright and other intellectual property rights related to that Content. You agree that any such Content or any derivative works, except for any personally identifiable information you submit in regards to your Account or an Order, may be disseminated, distributed, publicly displayed, reproduced, used, sublicensed, posted, or published by us, and searched, displayed, printed or otherwise used or exploited by our customers. To the extent you include personally identifiable information in forums on the Site, we will not be liable for such disclosure.

•	Has the potential to create liability for us or cause us to violate the requirements of or to lose the services, in whole or in part, of our Internet service providers or other suppliers.</p>
<p>Though we strive to enforce these rules with all of our users, you may be exposed through the Services to Content that violates our policies or is otherwise offensive. You access the Services at your own risk. We may, but are not obligated to, remove Content from the Site for any reason, including if we determine or suspect that such Content violates these Terms of Use. We are merely acting as a passive conduit for such distribution and we take no responsibility for your exposure to Content on the Site or through the Services whether it violates our content policies or not.</p>
<p>4.	GENERAL RULES OF USER CONDUCT. It is our goal to make access to our Services a good experience for all of our users. You agree not to, and represent and warrant that you will not use, reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Services, your use of the Services, or access to the Services for any purposes other than for which the Services are being provided to you, or do any of the following:<br />
•	Conduct or promote any illegal activities while using the Services;<br />
•	Attempt to reverse engineer or jeopardize the correct functioning of the Services, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the software (including the tools, methods, processes, and infrastructure) that enables or underlies the Services;<br />

<p>5.	FEEDBACK. In the event that you provide us any ideas, thoughts, criticisms, suggested improvements or other feedback related to the Services (collectively “Feedback”), you agree we may use the Feedback to modify our products and services and that you will not be due any compensation, including any royalty related to the product or service that incorporates your Feedback. You grant to us a worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid, perpetual, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, translate, distribute, perform, display, import, sell, offer for sale, make, have made and otherwise exploit the Feedback in any form, media, or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, and to allow others to do the same. This is true whether you provide the Feedback on through the Services or through any other method of communication with us, unless we have entered into a separate agreement with you that provides otherwise.</p>
<p>6.	BETA SERVICES.  From time to time, we may make beta services, features or tools with which you may experiment (collectively, “Beta Services”).  Such Beta Services are offered to you solely for experimental purposes and without warranty of any kind, and may be modified or discontinued at our sole discretion.  If we provide you access to a Beta Service you agree to assist us in the testing and evaluation of the Beta Service during the beta period and to provide Feedback, which we may use and will be governed by the provisions in Section 5.  The provisions of this section apply with full force to any Beta Services that are identified to you as beta.</p>
<p>7.	PAYMENT. When you purchase a meal through the Services, you are making that purchase through a Delivery Partner.  The Delivery Partner, and not us, is processing your credit card or other payment method. You agree to pay all fees or charges that you incur through the Services, including through Delivery Partners.  Your payment provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card, bank wire or financing arrangement and you must refer to that agreement and not these Terms of Use to determine your rights and liabilities. To pay for an order, you will need to provide our Delivery Partner with the information necessary to process an order from you, including your address and billing information.</p>
<p>8.	MODIFICATIONS TO THE SERVICES. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Services, or any portion of them, with or without notice to you. We will not be liable to you or any third party should we exercise our right to modify or discontinue the Site and/or Services. If you object to any such changes, your sole recourse will be to cease access to the Services. Continued access to the Services following notice of any such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and satisfaction with the Services as so modified. You agree that we, in our sole discretion, may immediately terminate your access to the Services at any time, for any reason, in our sole discretion. YOU AGREE THAT WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCESS TO THE SERVICES.</p>
<p>9.	PRIVACY AND SECURITY. We know that your privacy is important. For this reason, we have created a privacy policy [insert link] that describes our collection, use and disclosure practices regarding any personal information that you provide to us. The security of your personal information is important to us. While there is no such thing as &#8220;perfect security&#8221; on the Internet, we will take reasonable steps to help ensure the safety of your personal information. However, you understand and agree that such steps do not guarantee that the Services are invulnerable to all security breaches or immune from viruses, security threats or other vulnerabilities. Bask reserves the right to cooperate with local, state, provincial and national authorities in investigations of improper or unlawful activities and this may require the disclosure of your personal information. We may also report to other organizations about improper or unlawful user activities and this reporting may include disclosure of personal information relating to those individuals conducting such improper or unlawful activities.</p>
<p>10.	Third Parties.<br />
a.	 Delivery Partners.  As noted above, we provide the meal recommendation engine and the technology platform that allows you to order a meal through our Delivery Partners. When you purchase a meal, you do so through the applicable delivery partner and not us.  The Delivery Partners terms and conditions and their privacy policy govern your relationship with them and the delivery of the meal.  We assume no liability for the acts and omissions of the Delivery Partners.</p>
<p>b.	Restaurants.  In most cases we do not have a contractual relationship with the restaurants that prepare the menu items that we analyze and make available to you through the Services.  Like with the Delivery Partners, we are not liable for the acts and omissions of the restaurants or the quality of the food, including any injury that may result from any such act or omission.</p>
<p>c.	Third Party Content. Content from other users, suppliers, advertisers, and other third parties may be made available to you through the Services. For example, many of the menus and images associated with meals viewable through the Services are received from third parties and are third party content.  Because we do not control such content, you agree that we are not responsible for any such content. We do not make any guarantees about the accuracy, currency, suitability, or quality of the information in such content, and we assume no responsibility for unintended, objectionable, inaccurate, misleading, or unlawful content made available by others. The Services may contain links to websites not operated by us. We are not responsible for the content, products, materials, or practices (including privacy practices) of such websites. We make no warranty, representation, endorsement, or guarantee regarding, and accept no responsibility for, the quality, content, nature or reliability of third party websites, products or services accessible by hyperlink or otherwise from the Services. We provide these links for your convenience only and we do not control such websites. Our inclusion of links to such websites does not imply any endorsement of the materials on such third party websites or any association with their operators.  YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH ANY WEBSITES, CONTENT, PRODUCTS, MATERIALS, OR PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTY. </p>
<p>d.	App Store.  When you download one of our Apps, you may do so through Apple Corporation’s App Store, another third party.   You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and us and not the App Store.  As between the App Store and us, we, not the App Store, are solely responsible for the Services, including the Application, the content, maintenance, support services, and warranty, and addressing any claims relating to the Services (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement).  In order to use the App, you must have access to a wireless network, and you agree to pay all fees associated with such access.  You also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with the Services, including the App.  You acknowledge that the App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and will have the right to enforce them. The following applies to any App accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (“App Store Sourced Application”):</p>
<p>(i) Your use of the App Store Sourced Application must comply with the App Store Terms of Service.<br />
(ii) You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App Store Sourced Application. In the event of any failure of the App Store Sourced Application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App Store Sourced Application to you.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App Store Sourced Application. As between Bask and Apple, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of Bask.<br />
(iv) You and we acknowledge that, as between Bask and Apple, Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of the App Store Sourced Application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App Store Sourced Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.<br />
(v) You and we acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of that App Store Sourced Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between Bask and Apple, Bask, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by the Terms of Use.<br />
(vi) You and we acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of the Terms as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application, and that, upon your acceptance of the Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Terms as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.<br />
(vii) Without limiting any provisions of these Terms of Use, you must comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the App Store Sourced Application.<br />

<p>17.	CHANGES TO TERMS OF USE.

<p>18.	ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER, CLASS ACTION WAIVER, AND FORUM SELECTION CLAUSE<br />
(a)	Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation and scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, count, claim, or cause of action) between you and Bask or Bask’s employees, agents, successors, or assigns, will exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitration.<br />
(b)	Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). As modified by this Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively “Rules and Procedures”).<br />
(c)	You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.<br />
(d)	You and Bask must abide by the following rules: (a) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR BASK MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (b) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF, (c) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Bask will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (d) Bask also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (e) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (f) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (g) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (h) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees’ and litigation expenses, and then in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law.<br />
(e)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Bask may bring an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret will not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such claims will be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in New York, New York. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in New York, New York in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within New York, New York for such purpose. A request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.<br />
(f)	With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) in the paragraph above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (a) or (b) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void, and neither you nor Bask will be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be exclusively brought in state or federal court in New York, New York.<br />
(g)	For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org.<br />
19.	CHOICE OF LAW.  The Agreement is made under and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</p>
<p>20.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word including means including, without limitation. If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.  Your relationship to us is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other.  This Agreement, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without our prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.  The terms of this Agreement will be binding upon assignees. </p>
<p>21.	COPYRIGHT/TRADEMARK INFORMATION.  Copyright © 2014 Bask. All rights reserved.  All Marks displayed on the Services are our property or the property of other third parties. You are not permitted to use these Marks without our prior written consent or the consent of such third party which may own the Marks.</p>
<p>22.	SURVIVAL. Upon termination of this Agreement, all licenses and / or rights of access granted to you in this Agreement will terminate.  All other provisions will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms of Use for any reason.</p>
<p>23.	NOTICE; VIOLATIONS. We may give notice to you by email, a posting on the Services, or other reasonable means. You must give notice to us in writing via email to info@gobask.com or as otherwise expressly provided. Please report any violations of these Terms of Use to info@gobask.com. </p>
